## Questions
1. I would fit my automated tests within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed in my Recipe project development pipeline. This is optimal because it ensures code quality throughout development, allows for incremental testing, and helps catch bugs early. Automated testing on every push is a key part of continuous integration, making sure new code does not break existing functionality.

2. I would not use end to end testing to check whether is returning the correct output. A more appropriate testing method to test the correctness of a function would be a unit test. This is because E2E testing is typically used for testing an entire application where unit tests individual functions. As we want to test the validity of a specific function, unit tests would work best.
